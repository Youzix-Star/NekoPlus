 * fully open, and how they look once it is gone. The transforms interpolate between those two
 * ends as a pure function of the drag's progress, which is what keeps the finger tracking exact.
 *
 * @param pageFollowsFinger whether the dismissing page translates with the drag at all.
 * @param pageVerticalDrift whether it also tracks the finger's vertical movement.
 * @param pageScaleAtDismiss scale the dismissing page shrinks to as it leaves.
 * @param pageCornerRadiusAtDismiss corner radius it rounds to as it leaves, or `null` for square.
 * @param coveredParallaxFraction how far the revealed page slides toward the leading edge while it
 *   is covered, as a fraction of the screen width.
 * @param coveredDimAtRest how transparent the revealed page is while it is covered.
 * @param coveredScrimAtRest alpha of the dark scrim laid over the revealed page while covered.
 * @param commitSpec the animation that carries the drag to completion once the finger lifts.
 * @param cancelSpec the animation that springs the page back when the gesture is abandoned.
